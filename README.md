## 🎯 Project Objective

- **OTD Prediction** = The total time elapsed from the moment in which the order is input into the system until its final delivery at the customer's location in minutes.<br>
This prediction is crucial for ensuring the deliveries meet the minimum Service Level Agreement (SLA) of 120 minutes, thereby directly impacting customer satisfaction and logistics efficiency.



## 📊 Dataset and Simulation

The **Amazon Delivery Dataset** provides a comprehensive view of last-mile logistics operations, including:
- **43,632 deliveries** across multiple cities
- Order details and delivery agents information
- Weather and traffic conditions
- Delivery performance metrics

We also utilized Simpy for discrete-event simulation to model and analyze various scenarios related to delivery performance.
